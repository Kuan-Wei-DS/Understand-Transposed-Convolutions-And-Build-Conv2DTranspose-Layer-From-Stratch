# Understand-Transposed-Convolutions-And-Build-Conv2DTranspose-Layer-From-Stratch
In generative adversarial network (GAN), convolutions and transposed convolutions are both heavily involved. While convolutions play an important role in the discriminator, transposed convolutions are the primary building blocks for the generator. The tensorflow API - Keras - has made building GAN a very convenient process. However, sometimes it can be confusing of **what values should be used for the kernel size, strides, and padding to yield the right output shapes.** Setting the right values for the parameters require us to understand how transposed convolutions work. In this notebook, I would like to share some of my personal understandings about transposed convolutions. Throughout the notebook, I will use convolutions as the comparison to better explain transposed convolutions. I will also show you how I implement these understanding to build my own convolutional and transposed convolutional layers, which act as a naive version of the Conv2D and Conv2DTranspose layers from Keras. The notebook consists of three sections:  #### 1. What are transposed convolutions? #### 2. How do the parameters (kernel size, strides, and padding) affect transposed convolutions? #### 3. Build my own Conv2D and Conv2DTranspose layers from scratch
